As A Car Enthuisiast myself, I would like to create a website where other Car Enthuisiast can post pictures of their vehicles, as well being able to find new roads to drive on. 

Users should be able to create, post, update, and delete reviews of cars.

Users should be able to search the cars that are provided and be able to update them with reviews.

Car enthusiasts will be able to view cars and write reviews on them, which will help potential buyers and car lovers decide which car they should buy next.
